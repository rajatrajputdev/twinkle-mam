                    <h1 class="display-3 mb-4"><strong class="text-primary">Twinkle Sharma</strong>, She has been
                        teaching dance since 2008</h1>
                    <p>In a world where women often face societal pressures to conform to traditional roles, the
                        inspiring journey of Miss Twinkle serves as a powerful testament to resilience and
                        determination. Born and raised in Saharanpur, India, Twinkle began her dance training at the
                        tender age of five under the guidance of her maternal grandmother. Over the next six years, she
                        honed her skills, ultimately performing her first stage dance at the age of six. This early
                        success set the stage for a remarkable career, culminating in a performance before Russian
                        President Mikhail Gorbachev at the cultural house of the Russian embassy when she was eighteen.

                        Twinkle's talent did not go unnoticed; she quickly became a celebrated figure in her
                        hometown(Saharanpur), gaining recognition through numerous newspaper features and television
                        appearances. Her prowess in dance earned her accolades, including the prestigious Nritya
                        Guruvarya Awards and the Top 100 Women Icon Award. However, her life took a dramatic turn when
                        she married at twenty-one, coinciding with her with household chores . In the midst of family
                        obligations, she paused her artistic pursuits to care for him, temporarily sidelining her
                        dreams.

                        Following her household responsibilities, Twinkle faced a pivotal moment. Rather than allowing
                        her ambitions to remain dormant, she resolved to revive her passion for dance. Demonstrating
                        remarkable entrepreneurial spirit, she established two dance academies—"Shri Natraj Nritya
                        Academy"—in different cities, where she began teaching Kathak to aspiring dancers. Twinkle's
                        dedication to her craft and her commitment to empowering women became a driving force in her
                        life. She emerged as a role model, challenging the patriarchal norms that dictate women's roles
                        in society.

                        Twinkle's story highlights the theme of perseverance in the face of adversity. Despite the
                        societal expectation for women to prioritize household responsibilities after marriage, she
                        proved that it is possible to pursue one's passions and achieve professional success. Her
                        journey is a vivid illustration of how women can balance multiple roles while continuing to
                        strive for their dreams.

                        Twinkle's achievements resonate beyond her personal success; they serve as an inspiration for
                        countless women who may feel constrained by societal norms. Her narrative underscores the
                        importance of self-belief and hard work, illustrating that dreams can be fulfilled regardless of
                        life's challenges. As she continues to mentor young dancers, Twinkle not only preserves the art
                        of dance but also fosters a new generation of empowered women ready to break free from societal
                        limitations.

                        In conclusion, Miss Twinkle's life story is a compelling narrative of hope, resilience, and
                        triumph over adversity, emphasizing that with determination and courage, anyone can overcome
                        obstacles and achieve their dreams, regardless of the circumstances they face."</p>

                        the first Guru
                        and ultimate Guiding Light</h1>
                    <p>My journey into the mesmerizing world of Indian classical dance began with a stroke of divine
                        fortune under the profound guidance of my first guru, the illustrious Pandit Govardhan Maharaj
                        of Haridwar. Renowned across the nation as a master of Kathak, his presence radiates the essence
                        of tradition, discipline, and boundless creativity. His teachings went far beyond the rhythmic
                        patterns and intricate footwork; they delved deep into the soul of the art form, unveiling its
                        spiritual and emotional depths.

                        Pandit Govardhan Maharaj approached every lesson with unmatched passion and precision, leaving
                        an indelible mark on my heart and mind. His gentle yet firm guidance taught me that Kathak is
                        not merely a dance but a dialogue—a profound conversation between the dancer, the divine, and
                        the audience. Under his watchful eyes, I learned to weave stories through movement, to balance
                        grace with power, and to harmonize discipline with the spontaneity that breathes life into every
                        performance.

                        It is impossible to overstate the impact of his mentorship on my journey. Every spin, every
                        beat, and every gesture I execute carries the imprint of his wisdom. His teachings have not only
                        shaped my skills but enriched my soul, providing me with a lens through which to view life
                        itself—as a rhythm, a melody, and a story waiting to unfold.

                        I am eternally indebted to Pandit Govardhan Maharaj for sharing this priceless legacy with me.
                        His influence continues to illuminate my path, inspiring me to honor the tradition he so
                        lovingly imparted and to ensure that the flame of Kathak remains vibrant for future generations.
                        It is my life's mission to share this art with the same passion, precision, and reverence that
                        he bestowed upon me.</p>

                        Shrimati Geetanjali Lal, a renowned Kathak maestro celebrated worldwide for her contributions to
                        the art form. As one of the leading exponents of the Jaipur Gharana of Kathak, her dedication to
                        preserving and innovating this timeless tradition is unparalleled. Her expertise in abhinaya,
                        intricate rhythmic footwork, and emotive storytelling has left an indelible mark on my artistic
                        growth.

                        Shrimati Geetanjali Lal’s illustrious career spans decades, enriched by her training under
                        legendary figures such as Pandit Gopi Krishna and Roshan Kumari. She has held esteemed
                        positions, including Chief of Repertory and Director at Kathak Kendra, and is a top-grade artist
                        with Doordarshan and ICCR. Her achievements include the prestigious Sangeet Natak Akademi Award,
                        as well as numerous other accolades such as “Nritya Sharada,” “Bharat Gaurav,” and “Kalpana
                        Chawla Award.” Her choreographic brilliance has been showcased globally, blending traditional
                        themes with contemporary narratives.

                        Under her guidance, I have had the privilege of honing my skills through workshops and
                        performances across Delhi and various other regions in India. These experiences have profoundly
                        shaped my artistic journey, instilling discipline, creativity, and a deep reverence for Kathak.
                        Guru Maa’s influence has not only elevated my craft but also enriched my understanding of the
                        cultural and spiritual essence of this dance form.

                        It is with heartfelt gratitude that I dedicate this platform to honoring her mentorship and her
                        relentless efforts in keeping the flame of Kathak alive for generations to come. Her teachings

                        workshops provided me with not only a refined understanding of rhythm and expression but also a
                        deeper connection to the stories and emotions that Kathak brings to life. His ability to merge
                        tradition with a contemporary perspective inspired me to embrace this art form with reverence
                        and creativity.

                        I had the privilege of participating in his workshops across various cities, including Jaipur,
                        Udaipur, and the renowned Delhi Kla Kendra. Each location became a canvas for learning, where
                        Shri Gangani Ji shared his vast knowledge and helped nurture my artistic journey. These
                        experiences were not just about dance but about imbibing the discipline, passion, and spiritual
                        essence that Kathak represents.

                        Shri Rajendra Gangani Ji’s influence has left an indelible mark on my growth as a performer and
                        an individual. I owe my artistic evolution and deeper appreciation of Indian classical arts to
                        his unwavering support and meticulous guidance.

                        It is with immense gratitude and admiration that I dedicate this space to express my heartfelt
                        thanks to Shri Rajendra Gangani Ji for his invaluable mentorship. His teachings have not only
                        shaped my journey but also instilled in me the responsibility to honor and perpetuate the rich
                        heritage of Kathak for future generations.

                        my journey. His influence has shaped me into the person I am today, and I am eternally grateful

                    <h1 class="display-3 mb-4">Workshop under Kathak Majestro<strong class="text-primary"> Shrimati Vidha Lal Ji</strong></h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">The art of Kathak is a timeless tradition, blending storytelling, rhythm, and
                        spiritual expression. My journey into this exquisite world was profoundly shaped by the guidance
                        of Shrimati Vidha Lal, an iconic figure in Indian classical dance. Known for her extraordinary
                        talent and dedication to preserving the Jaipur Gharana, Shrimati Vidha Lal is celebrated for her
                        impeccable technique, innovative choreographies, and global contributions to Kathak.

                        As an empanelled artist of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) and an ‘A’ grade
                        performer for Doordarshan, Shrimati Vidha Lal has showcased Kathak on some of the most
                        prestigious stages worldwide. Her performances at the Khajuraho Dance Festival, Kala Ghoda Arts
                        Festival, and international events in Paris, New York, Vienna, and beyond have left audiences
                        spellbound. She has earned countless accolades, including the Sri Krishna Gana Sabha Endowment
                        Award, and set a Guinness World Record with an astonishing 103 spins in one minute—a testament
                        to her technical mastery and creative spirit.

                        Under her mentorship, I, Twinkle Sharma, have had the privilege of participating in multiple
                        workshops across Delhi and other cities in India. Each session was a revelation, deepening my
                        understanding of the intricate rhythms, graceful movements, and emotive storytelling that define
                        Kathak. Shrimati Vidha Lal’s personalized teaching approach nurtured not just my skills but also
                        my connection to the art’s rich heritage.

                        Her teachings go beyond the steps and spins of dance; they are imbued with life lessons about
                        discipline, dedication, and artistic integrity. Her ability to blend traditional techniques with
                        contemporary perspectives inspired me to explore new horizons while staying rooted in the
                        classical ethos. From Delhi’s vibrant cultural hubs to serene workshops in other cities, every
                        moment under her guidance was transformative, instilling in me a profound respect for this
                        ancient art form.

                        Shrimati Vidha Lal’s illustrious career is marked by her pioneering spirit and relentless
                        passion for Kathak. Her international tours have brought Indian classical dance to audiences
                        across France, Germany, the USA, Canada, and Singapore, among many other countries, spreading
                        the essence of Kathak to a global audience. She has performed for esteemed occasions, including
                        a special choreography at Rashtrapati Bhavan in honor of foreign dignitaries and celebrations
                        marking the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore.

                        It is with immense gratitude and admiration that I dedicate this platform to honor Shrimati
                        Vidha Lal’s invaluable contributions to my artistic journey and the larger realm of Indian
                        classical dance. Her mentorship has not only shaped my craft but has also instilled a lifelong
                        commitment to upholding and promoting the beauty of Kathak.</p>
